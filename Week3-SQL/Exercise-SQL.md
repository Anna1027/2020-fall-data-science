# SQL:  Structured Query Language  Exercise

### Getting Started
1. Go to BigQuery UI https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery
2. Add in the public data sets. 
	3. Click the Add Data icon
	4. Add any dataset
	5. `bigquery-public-data` should become visible and populate in the BigQuery UI. 
3. Add your queries where it says [YOUR QUERY HERE].
4. Make sure you add your query in between the triple tick marks. 
---

For this section of the exercise we will be using the `bigquery-public-data.austin_311.311_service_requests`  table. 

5. Write a query that tells us how many rows are in the table. 
	```
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS `Num_rows`
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.austin_311.311_service_requests`

	```

7. Write a query that tells us how many _distinct_ values there are in the complaint_description column.
	``` 
SELECT
  COUNT (DISTINCT(`complaint_description`)) AS `Num_values`
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.austin_311.311_service_requests`

	```
  
8. Write a query that counts how many times each owning_department appears in the table and orders them from highest to lowest. 
	``` 
SELECT
  COUNT(`owning_department`) AS n
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.austin_311.311_service_requests`
GROUP BY
  owning_department
ORDER BY
  n DESC

	```

9. Write a query that lists the top 5 complaint_description that appear most and the amount of times they appear in this table. (hint... limit)
	```
SELECT
  COUNT (`complaint_description`) AS `TOP5`
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.austin_311.311_service_requests`
GROUP BY
  `complaint_description`
ORDER BY
  `TOP5` DESC
LIMIT
  5;

	```
10. Write a query that lists and counts all the complaint_description, just for the where the owning_department is 'Animal Services Office'.
	```
SELECT
  COUNT (`complaint_description`) AS `cd`,
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.austin_311.311_service_requests`
WHERE
  owning_department = 'Animal Services Office'

	```

11. Write a query to check if there are any duplicate values in the unique_key column (hint.. There are two was to do this, one is to use a temporary table for the groupby, then filter for values that have more than one count, or, using just one table but including the  `having` function). 
	```
SELECT
  unique_key, COUNT(*)
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.austin_311.311_service_requests`
GROUP BY unique_key
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 

	```


### For the next question, use the `census_bureau_usa` tables.

1. Write a query that returns each zipcode and their population for 2000 and 2010. 
	```
SELECT
  A.zipcode as zipcode, A.population as pop_2000, B.population as pop_2010
FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_usa.population_by_zip_2000` as A inner join `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_usa.population_by_zip_2010` as B ON A.zipcode = B.zipcode
	```

### For the next section, use the  `bigquery-public-data.google_political_ads.advertiser_weekly_spend` table.
1. Using the `advertiser_weekly_spend` table, write a query that finds the advertiser_name that spent the most in usd. 
	```
SELECT
  advertiser_name,
  SUM(spend_usd) AS total_spent
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.google_political_ads.advertiser_weekly_spend`
GROUP BY
  advertiser_name
ORDER BY
  total_spent DESC
	```
2. Who was the 6th highest spender? (No need to insert query here, just type in the answer.)
	```
TOM STEYER 2020
	```

3. What week_start_date had the highest spend? (No need to insert query here, just type in the answer.)
	```
2020-09-20
	```

4. Using the `advertiser_weekly_spend` table, write a query that returns the sum of spend by week (using week_start_date) in usd for the month of August only. 
	```
SELECT
  week_start_date ,
  SUM(spend_usd) AS total_spent
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.google_political_ads.advertiser_weekly_spend`
where
week_start_date >= '2020-08-01' and week_start_date <'2020-09-01'
GROUP BY
  week_start_date
	```
6.  How many ads did the 'TOM STEYER 2020' campaign run? (No need to insert query here, just type in the answer.)
	```
50
	```
7. Write a query that has, in the US region only, the total spend in usd for each advertiser_name and how many ads they ran. (Hint, you're going to have to join tables for this one). 
	```
WITH
  Total_spent AS (
  SELECT
    advertiser_name,
    SUM(spend_usd) AS total_spent
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.google_political_ads.advertiser_weekly_spend`
  GROUP BY
    advertiser_name ),
  Number_of_ads AS(
  SELECT
    advertiser_name,
    COUNT(advertiser_name ) AS number_of_ads
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.google_political_ads.advertiser_weekly_spend`
  GROUP BY
    advertiser_name )
SELECT
  Total_spent.advertiser_name,
  Total_spent.total_spent,
  Number_of_ads.number_of_ads
FROM
  Total_spent
JOIN
  Number_of_ads
ON
  Total_spent.advertiser_name=Number_of_ads.advertiser_name
  order by total_spent desc
	```
8. For each advertiser_name, find the average spend per ad. 
	```
SELECT
  advertiser_name,
  AVG(spend_usd) AS avg_spend_per_ad
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.google_political_ads.advertiser_weekly_spend`
WHERE
  spend_usd > 0
GROUP BY
  advertiser_name
	```
10. Which advertiser_name had the lowest average spend per ad that was at least above 0. 
	``` 
SELECT
  advertiser_name,
  AVG(spend_usd) AS avg_spend_per_ad
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.google_political_ads.advertiser_weekly_spend`
WHERE
  spend_usd > 0
GROUP BY
  advertiser_name
ORDER BY
    avg_spend_per_ad ASC
	```
## For this next section, use the `new_york_citibike` datasets.

1. Who went on more bike trips, Males or Females?
	```
SELECT
  gender,
  COUNT(gender) AS gender_count
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips`
GROUP BY
  gender
	```
2. What was the average, shortest, and longest bike trip taken in minutes?
	```
SELECT
  AVG(tripduration / 60) AS avg_tripduration,
  MIN(tripduration / 60) AS shortest_trip,
  MAX(tripduration / 60) AS longest_trip
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips`
	```


3. Write a query that, for every station_name, has the amount of trips that started there and the amount of trips that ended there. (Hint, use two temporary tables, one that counts the amount of starts, the other that counts the number of ends, and then join the two.) 
	```
WITH STARTS AS
(
    SELECT
      start_station_id,
      COUNT(start_station_id) AS start_count
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips`
    GROUP BY
      start_station_id
),
ENDS AS
(
    SELECT
      end_station_id,
      COUNT(end_station_id) AS end_count
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips`
    GROUP BY
      end_station_id
)
SELECT
  *
FROM
  STARTS
  INNER JOIN ENDS ON STARTS.start_station_id = ENDS.end_station_id
	```
